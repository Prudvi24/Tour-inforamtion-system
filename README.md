An information system is defined as the software that helps organize, storage and analyze data. So, the purpose of an information system is to turn raw data into useful information that can be used for decision making in an organization.
The information provided by the passenger information system depends on its location, and the technical scope and providing the information in different languages and also the general advice on current travel disruptions that may be useful to the passenger
in understanding the implications for their travel plans.
On vehicle, it is normal to provide up to date predictions of
What is the next station or stop?
When it will arrive?
How closely it is running to timetable?
Advice on connecting services.
Personalised channels( web, mobile device) will normally be set up to mimic the view
from a station but may in addition be linked to journey planners. Using such systems
a passenger may plan his/her journey to take into account cur
circumstances(such as cancelled services or excessive delays).
